### Getting access to Chrome Web Store

- You need to be a member of the Google group `aergo-connect@blocko.io` to access the "Aergo" publisher in Chrome Web Store.

- In my experience, review can take anything from 1-4 weeks.

Letâ€™s hope they review and reinstate it quickly.
I documented the process here:
